# MSc_BSE_2023_Deep_Learning
Final deep learning project (BSE 2023) by Miguel Connor and Ram√≥n Talvi. 

**Abstract**: 

In this project, we train a You Only Look Once (YOLO) model on a dataset of 292 images of chess peices
with 2894 labels to make a real time object detector and classifier. We can predict on pictures, videos, and
create a real time webcam output on our own chess pieces. We discuss the theory and limitations of these
models, and some of the comparisons of the recent improvements on the original YOLO algorithm.
